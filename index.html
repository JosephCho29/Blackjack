                <p>The objective of Blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.</p>
                <p>Number cards are worth their face value, face cards (J, Q, K) are worth 10, and Aces can be worth 1 or 11.</p>
                <p>Each player starts with two cards, one of the dealer's cards is hidden until the end.</p>
                <p>To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stay' is to hold your total and end your turn.</p>
                <p>If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.</p>
                <p>If you are dealt 21 from the start (Ace & 10), you got a blackjack.</p>
                <p>Dealer will hit until his/her cards total 17 or higher.</p>
